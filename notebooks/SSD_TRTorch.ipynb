    "To compile with TRTorch the model must first be in TorchScript. TorchScript is a programming language included in PyTorch which removes the Python dependency normal PyTorch models have. This conversion is done via a JIT compiler which given a PyTorch Module will generate an equivalent TorchScript Module. There are two paths that can be used to generate TorchScript: tracing and scripting. Tracing follows execution of PyTorch generating ops in TorchScript corresponding to what it sees. Scripting does an analysis of the Python code and generates TorchScript, this allows the resulting graph to include control flow which tracing cannot do. Tracing however due to its simplicity is more likely to compile successfully with TRTorch (though both systems are supported)."
